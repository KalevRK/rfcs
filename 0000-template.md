# RFC N: Brief Title

## Summary
One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation
Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed Design
This is the bulk of the RFC.

Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with our sourcecode to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## Drawbacks/Consequences
Why should we not do this? Please consider the impact on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features, on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives
What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

This section could also include prior art, that is, how other frameworks in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved Questions
Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded] If deprecated, indicate why. If superseded, include a link to the new RFC.
