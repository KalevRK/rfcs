# RLC RFCs
## Intro
Jerry created this repo as a proposed single point of reference for RLC RFC (Request for Comment) or ADR (Architecture Decision Records) documents. This seems like a good idea to me, so I'd like to propose we use it. If we agree this README should mutate to describe our process.

I've created a proposed RFC/ADR document, _0000-template.md_, synthesizing some of the common elements from the example repos and documentation below. The **Status** section seems like it could be useful, but maybe that would just be managed through the PR process.
